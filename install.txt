1. make sure all iSCSI portals are configured correctly.
2. copy xtremio.py to cinder/volume/drivers/emc. on a RDO the full install the
   path is:
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cinder/volume/drivers/emc/xtremio.py
3. edit cinder.conf and add the configuration below.
   usually the full path is: /etc/cinder/cinder.conf
  a. for iSCSI use:
 volume_driver=cinder.volume.drivers.emc.xtremio.XtremIOISCSIDriver
  b. for FibreChannel use:
 volume_driver=cinder.volume.drivers.emc.xtremio.XtremIOFibreChannelDriver
 san_ip=[xms ip address or host name]
 san_login=[xms username with configure privileges]
 san_password=[xms password]
4. restart cinder:
  openstack-service restart cinder-volume
5. Optional on iSCSI: set Cluster authentication mode to initiator

Note on FibreChannel:
Some Linux hosts has a bug in the FC driver that prevents volumes mapped to 
lun 0 from being exposed by the driver as a device. this might show as an 
error in the OpenStack.
As a work around create a dummy volume per initiator and map it to lun 0.
